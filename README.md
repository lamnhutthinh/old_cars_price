# Old cars' price prediction
Old cars' price prediction base on some features such as mileage, engine size, ... using regression machine learning models. This dataset is collected from Kaggle flatform. I use python and jupyter notebook to process the data and deploy the models. I tried to compare 3 models to improve predictive results and it worked!
